  "Hi, my name is Coltan Franke. I'm a software engineer living in Austin, Texas with 5+ years of professional experience developing desktop applications (with some server capabilities). Most of those projects were written in C/C++ and Java.",
  "Besides my day job, I also work on side projects, most of them as practice for becoming a better developer. I like automation and building Python projects, so I use that in many of my side projects. I've been really into writing Flask applications recently, which pairs web dev and Python nicely. I've also been learning React.",
  "Some non-tech stuff: I live in Austin with my amazing girlfriend and our dog and cat. In my free time, I like to watch TV, movies, and sports (I'm a huge Lakers fan), play video games, exercise, and go hiking.",
